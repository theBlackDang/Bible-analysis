# Orginal sin

Original Sin is a term that defines the nature of mankind’s sinful condition because of Adam’s fall. It teaches that all people are corrupted by Adam’s sin through natural generation, by which—together with Adam’s imputed condemnation—we all enter the world guilty before God.


Adam sinned:
> And the Lord God commanded the man, “You are free to eat from any tree in the garden;but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it you will surely die.”
>> -- [Genesis 2:16-17](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/1/2/)

> When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
>> -- [Genesis 3:6](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/1/3/)
