1. Perseverance is the idea that those who are truly born again will be empowered by the Spirit to continue to believe until the day they die.
> Shining as Stars<br/>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose.
>> -- [Philippians 2:12-13](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/50/2/)

What about the person who once believed and turns away from the faith completely?
> They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us.
>> -- [1John 2:19](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/62/2/)

> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’
>> -- [Matthew 7:21-23](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/40/7/)

Can we reject the faith?
> “Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven.But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.
>> -- [Matthew 10:32-33](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/40/10/)

Eternal security is not reciting the sinner prayer , renouncing the faith and going to heaven

2. Preservation refers to God's ability to keep, protect or "preserve" those who are truly His from stumbling, falling or turning away from faith

> being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.
>> -- [Philippians 1:6](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/50/1/)

> To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy—
>> -- [Jude 24](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/65/2/)

> who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
>> -- [1Peter 1:5](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/60/1/)

> I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.
>> -- [John 10:28-29](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/43/10/)

> For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
>> -- [Romans 8:38-39](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/45/8/)
