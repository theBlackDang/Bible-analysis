Paul on God's Sovereign Choice

> Not only that, but Rebekah’s children had one and the same father, our father Isaac.Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand:not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!For he says to Moses,<br/>“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,<br/>and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”It does not, therefore, depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?”But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’”Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction?What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory—even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?
>> -- [Romans 9:10-24](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/45/9/)

People believes in Good News because God appointed them for eternal life
> When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.
>> -- [Acts 13:48](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/44/13/)

People disobey the message will stumble because that what they were destined for
> and,<br/>“A stone that causes men to stumble<br/>and a rock that makes them fall.”<br/>They stumble because they disobey the message—which is also what they were destined for.
>> -- [1Peter 2:8](https://bible-api-bff.bai.uno/bolls-life/NIV/60/2/)


The chosen are predestined to be conformed to the image of Christ
> For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.

> but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.I and the Father are one.”

> The beast, which you saw, once was, now is not, and will come up out of the Abyss and go to his destruction.
